This is a placeholder for the actual og-image.jpg file that should be created by a designer.

For optimal Open Graph results, this image should:
- Be 1200 x 630 pixels (minimum)
- Have a clear, visually appealing representation of Memorix
- Feature the main value proposition
- Include the Memorix logo
- Use a consistent color scheme with the website
- Be optimized for fast loading
- Have the main content centered (to account for different cropping on platforms)

The actual image should be created by a designer and saved as og-image.jpg in this same directory.
